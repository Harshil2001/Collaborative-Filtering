# Collaborative-Filtering

For this project I did the following steps:
- Downloaded the required dataset, imported, and converted into the required array.
- Derived the unique users and movies.
- Centered the data with respect to the mean of each userâ€™s rating.
- Computed the weights.
- Predicted the ratings using the weights and the given formula.

Got the following Evaluation errors:
- Mean Absolute Error - 1.86
- Root Mean Squared Error - 3.64
